# Creative Labs - DSP Firmwares (CT1341/CT1741)

This repository contains the firmware dumps and assembly files of the Sound Blaster Pro 2 (CT1341 8051 chip) and Sound Blaster 16/AWE32/AWE64 (CT1741, 8052 chip) produced between 1990 and 2000 which use a DSP chip to process audio instructions.

## - Firmware Binaries:<br>
All of the firmware binaries can be found here: https://github.com/S95Sedan/CT1747_DSP/tree/main/firmware<br>
The firmware binaries for all the versions are uploaded, version 4.04, 4.05, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13 and 4.16.<br>
Aswell as a patched version which fixes bugs in the original firmware.<br>
They can de disassembled using the software below.<br>
<br>
## - Disassembly Files:<br>
Most of the disassembly mappings can be found here: https://github.com/S95Sedan/CT1747_DSP/tree/main/disassembly<br>
The mappings uploaded are for version, 3.02, 4.04, 4.05, 4.13 and 4.16.<br>
The binaries can be disassembled using D52 which is found here: [Link](https://www.bipom.com/dis51.php)
<br>
## - Assembly Files:<br>
Most of the assembly files can be found here: https://github.com/S95Sedan/CT1747_DSP/tree/main/assembly<br>
Versions currently uploaded are version, 3.02, 4.04, 4.05, 4.13 and 4.16.<br>
Aswell as a patched version which fixes bugs in the original firmware.<br>
They can be compiled with AS31 found here: [Link](https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/)<br>
The complied files return an exact match as how the firmware would be on the cards dsp chip.<br>
<br>
<br>
All the files on here are uploaded for archival and educational purpose, the license for them belongs to Creative Labs.<br>
None of this would have been possible without the people from MAME, Vogons and Siliconp0rn.<br>
